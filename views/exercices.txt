  Do 10 right rotations. add 1,3,4,5 at the start

  Do 6 left rotations. Remove the 3 first values of the top.

  Do 2 right rotations.

  Return the array you obtain
   

   //PHP

  function rightRotation(array, num){

     for(var i=0; i < array.length ; i++){
        

           //remove last el , add it to the start

     }


  }


  function leftRotation(){

       //remove first el , add it to the end


  }


 hash

  ex2 :

   So , brute force.



   loop on the word , and check remaining letters. So, yeah , remove each word used.

   Ok. If there is a mismatch , break.



   maybe , could we use a hash function , independent of order. ok.



  Ok. until 20h15


ex3

bubble sort


ex4 :

strings 

20h30




function makeAnagram :

string A , string B 


return : the minumum total characters that must be deleted


what if not an anagram.


karp rabin.



I think that we could scan the two arrays , and check if there are maching hashes. We could store all the maching hashes ,

take the bigger, and compare it with this hash length.


brute force :

get all possible words from array A , get all possible words from array B.


Have each word check other words. remove both el when match.




ex 4 (20h42) :


Absolute difference in an array :



Get all pairs , and make pairs. Store diff. Get the better





greedy 

ex 5 :





search 

ex 6 : 21h20


Hash tables : ice cream parlor 


Complete the function whatFlavors


function whatFlavors ==>
   
   price , money ==> return the indices of the 2 flavors they purchase.


   Each need to have 2 flavors having a sum of ...

given money val, cost / t

for each trip t ==> smallest id first


So , what are the two values that represent the value (or , 2 vals but implied 2).



Brute force ==> get pairs total . Once you get a sum, break. (when you loop on an el , you remove it).



So, it simply means there are several pools available?

Same calc.


ex 7 :



I'm coding it all up in PHP
