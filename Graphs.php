Exercice 1 :

Traverse this tree using BFS
                 A
            B          C
        D      E    F    G

Exercice 2 :

 Traverse this stree using depth first search


                  A
            B          C
        D      E    F    G


Exercice 3 : What's the worst time complexity of DFS?


Given n the number of nodes , and m the number of vertexes


   answer 1 = constant;

   answer 2 = log(n);

   answer 3 = log(m^2);

   answer 3 = O(n + m);

   answer 4 = log(m+n^3) ;

   answer 5 = m * log(n);     
  


 answer : 3 



Exercice 4 : What's the worst time complexity of BFS?



answer 1 = constant;

answer 2 = log(n*m);

answer 3 = log(n+m);   

answer 3 = O(n + m^2);

answer 4 = log(m+n^3) ;

answer 5 = O(n+m) //checking the vertices



answer : 3
